1. Create a dictionary called `dict_roof_types` with initial keys of `type1` and `type2` and give them values of 1 and 3.
2. Add a third key `type3` with a value of '6'.
3. Add code to check if a key of `type4` exists. If it does not add it to the dictionary with a value of 1 if it does, increment its value by 1
4. Add code to check if a key of `type2` exists. If it does not add it to the dictionary with a value of 1 if it does, increment its value by 1
5. Print out all of the keys and values from the dictionary
