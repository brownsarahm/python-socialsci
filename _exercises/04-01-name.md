def process_name(full_name):
    user_name = full_name.replace(' ','_')

    first, last = full_name.split()
    return user_name

volume, surface_area, length_of_edges = cuboid(2,3,4)
print('Volume = ', volume, ' Surface_area = ', surface_area, ' Sum of edges = ', length_of_edges)

The cuboid function above returns all three values from a single call. This means that you need three variables in which to place the 3 returned values. If you do not provide three variables, you will get an error.
Unless you are always going to use the 3 values, it would probably be better in this case to use distinct functions for these three cases.

1. Write a function that accepts strings for first and last names and returns a user name that is the first letter of the first name and the whole last name.

2. Supposing that in addition to the user name you also need the full name for display. Is it better to have two separate functions or I write a single function to provide both values together?
