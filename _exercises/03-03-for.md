The format of `variablelist` is very much like that of a record in a csv file. In later episodes we will see how we can extract these values and assign them to variables for further processing rather than printing them out.

In example8 the split method is used to break the `longString` variable down into a list of individual words which are then iterated through.

Suppose that we have a string containing a set of 4 different values separated by ','  like this:

~~~
variablelist = "01/01/2010,34.5,Yellow,True"
~~~
{: .language-python}

Research the `split()` method and then rewrite example 8 so that it prints the 4 components of `variablelist`
